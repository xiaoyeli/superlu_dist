%------ GPU effort for sparse factorizations
% Krawezik and Poole [64], Lucas et al. [69], Pierce et al. [72], and
% Vuduc et al. [79] have worked on multifrontal factorization methods for GPUs.
% All four methods use the GPU merely as a BLAS accelerator, by transferring
% one frontal matrix at a time to the GPU and then retrieving the results.
% The assembly operations are done in the CPU. As far as we know, no one has
% yet considered a GPU-based method for multifrontal sparse QR factorization,
% and no one has considered a GPU-based multifrontal method
% (LU, QR, or Cholesky) where an entire subtree is transfered to the
% GPU. Our algorithm (Tim Davis' DOE proposal) will be the first of its kind.

abstract = {Many scientific applications rely on sparse direct solvers for their numerical robustness. However, performance optimization for these solvers remains a challenging task, especially on GPUs. This is due to workloads of small dense matrices that are different in size. Matrix decompositions on such irregular workloads are rarely addressed on GPUs.This paper addresses irregular workloads of matrix computations on GPUs, and their application to accelerate sparse direct solvers. We design an interface for the basic matrix operations supporting problems of different sizes. The interface enables us to develop irrLU-GPU, an LU decomposition on matrices of different sizes. We demonstrate the impact of irrLU-GPU on sparse direct LU solvers using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Experimental results are shown for a sparse direct solver based on a multifrontal sparse LU decomposition applied to linear systems arising from the simulation, using finite element discretization on unstructured meshes, of a high-frequency indefinite Maxwell problem.},

abstract = {We introduce a new parallel algorithm for solving sparse LU factorization of planar matrices, which commonly arise in the finite element method for 2D PDEs. Existing scalable methods, such as the multifrontal approach with subtree-to-subcube mapping by Gupta et al. [1] and right-looking with 3D mapping by Sao et al. [2] fail to achieve optimal communication costs for these matrices. Our new algorithm combines 3D mapping and subtree-to-subcube mapping to minimize communication costs while allowing trade-offs between extra memory and reduced communication. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm attains the communication lower bound up to a factor of O(log log n) in the memory-optimal case and up to a factor of O(log P) in the memory-independent case for an n-dimensional planar sparse matrix on P processors.},

abstract = {This article presents a fast and approximate multifrontal solver for large sparse linear systems. In a recent work by Liu et&nbsp;al., we showed the efficiency of a multifrontal solver leveraging the butterfly algorithm and its hierarchical matrix extension, HODBF (hierarchical off-diagonal butterfly) compression to compress large frontal matrices. The resulting multifrontal solver can attain quasi-linear computation and memory complexity when applied to sparse linear systems arising from spatial discretization of high-frequency wave equations. To further reduce the overall number of operations and especially the factorization memory usage to scale to larger problem sizes, in this article we develop a composite multifrontal solver that employs the HODBF format for large-sized fronts, a reduced-memory version of the nonhierarchical block low-rank format for medium-sized fronts, and a lossy compression format for small-sized fronts. This allows us to solve sparse linear systems of dimension up to 2.7 \texttimes{} larger than before and leads to a memory consumption that is reduced by 70\% while ensuring the same execution time. The code is made publicly available in GitHub.},
