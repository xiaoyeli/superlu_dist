		SuperLU_DIST (version 5.1)
		============================

SuperLU_DIST contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system 
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with static pivoting (GESP). 
Static pivoting is a technique that combines the numerical stability of
partial pivoting with the scalability of Cholesky (no pivoting),
to run accurately and efficiently on large numbers of processors. 

SuperLU_DIST is a parallel extension to the serial SuperLU library.
It is targeted for the distributed memory parallel machines.
SuperLU_DIST is implemented in ANSI C, and MPI for communications.
Currently, the LU factorization and triangular solution routines,
which are the most time-consuming part of the solution process,
are parallelized. The other routines, such as static pivoting and 
column preordering for sparsity are performed sequentially. 
This "alpha" release contains double-precision real and double-precision
complex data types.

The distribution contains the following directory structure:

  SuperLU_DIST/README    instructions on installation
  SuperLU_DIST/CBLAS/    needed BLAS routines in C, not necessarily fast
  SuperLU_DIST/DOC/  	 the Users' Guide

  SuperLU_DIST/SRC/      C source code, to be compiled into libsuperlu_dist.a
  SuperLU_DIST/lib/      contains library archive libsuperlu_dist.a
  SuperLU_DIST/Makefile  top level Makefile that does installation and testing

                         preprocessor definitions, included in all Makefiles.
                         (You may need to edit it to suit for your system
                          before compiling the whole package.)

----------------
| INSTALLATION |
----------------

There are two ways to install the package. One requires users to 
edit makefile manually, the other uses CMake build system.
The procedures are described below.

1. Manual installation with makefile.
   Before installing the package, please examine the three things dependent 
   on your system setup:

   1.1 Edit the make.inc include file.

       This make include file is referenced inside each of the Makefiles
       in the various subdirectories. As a result, there is no need to 
       edit the Makefiles in the subdirectories. All information that is
       machine specific has been defined in this include file. 

       Sample machine-specific make.inc are provided in the MAKE_INC/
       directory for several platforms, such as Cray XT5 and IBM SP.
       When you have selected the machine to which you wish to install
       SuperLU_DIST, copy the appropriate sample include file 
       (if one is present) into make.inc.
       For example, if you wish to run SuperLU_DIST on a Cray XT5,  you can do

       	   cp MAKE_INC/make.xc30  make.inc
   
	For the systems other than listed above, some porting effort is needed
   	for parallel factorization routines. Please refer to the Users' Guide 
   	for detailed instructions on porting.

   	The following CPP definitions can be set in CFLAGS.
      	  o -D_LONGINT
          use 64-bit integers for indexing sparse matrices. (default 32 bit)

      	  o -DPRNTlevel=[0,1,2,...]
          printing level to show solver's execution details. (default 0)

      	  o -DDEBUGlevel=[0,1,2,...]
          diagnostic printing level for debugging purpose. (default 0)
      
   
   1.2. The BLAS library.

   	The parallel routines in SuperLU_DIST uses some sequential BLAS routines
   	on each process. If there is BLAS library available on your machine,
   	you may define the following in the file make.inc:
            BLASDEF = -DUSE_VENDOR_BLAS
            BLASLIB = <BLAS library you wish to link with>

   	    The CBLAS/ subdirectory contains the part of the C BLAS needed by 
   	    SuperLU_DIST package. However, these codes are intended for use
	    only if there is no faster implementation of the BLAS already
	    available on your machine. In this case, you should go to the
	    top-level SuperLU_DIST/ directory and do the following:

	    1) In make.inc, undefine (comment out) BLASDEF, and define:
               BLASLIB = ../lib/libblas$(PLAT).a

    	    2) Type: make blaslib
       	       to make the BLAS library from the routines in the
	       CBLAS/ subdirectory.


   1.3. External libraries: Metis and ParMetis.

      If you will use Metis or ParMetis ordering, you will
      need to install them yourself. Since ParMetis package already
      contains the source code for the Metis library, you can just
      download and compile ParMetis from:
      http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/download

      After you have installed it, you should define the following in make.inc:
        METISLIB = -L<metis directory> -lmetis
        PARMETISLIB = -L<parmetis directory> -lparmetis
        I_PARMETIS = -I<parmetis directory>/include -I<parmetis directory>/metis/include

   1.4. C preprocessor definition CDEFS.

   	In the header file SRC/Cnames.h, we use macros to determine how
   	C routines should be named so that they are callable by Fortran.
   	(Some vendor-supplied BLAS libraries do not have C interfaces. So the 
    	re-naming is needed in order for the SuperLU BLAS calls (in C) to 
    	interface with the Fortran-style BLAS.)
   	The possible options for CDEFS are:

       	o -DAdd_: Fortran expects a C routine to have an underscore
		  postfixed to the name;
		  (This is set as the default)
        o -DNoChange: Fortran expects a C routine name to be identical to
		      that compiled by C;
        o -DUpCase: Fortran expects a C routine name to be all uppercase.
   
   1.5. Multicore and GPU (optional).
   
	To use OpenMP parallelism, need to set the number of threads as follows:

 	     setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS <##>

   	To enable Nvidia GPU access, need to take the following 2 step:
      	  1) set the following Linux environment variable:

	     setenv ACC GPU

      	  2) Add the CUDA library location in make.inc:

    	  ifeq "${ACC}" "GPU"
      	       CUDA_FLAGS = -DGPU_ACC
               INCS += -I<CUDA directory>/include
      	       LIBS += -L<CUDA directory>/lib64 -lcublas -lcudart 
    	  endif

   A Makefile is provided in each subdirectory. The installation can be done
   completely automatically by simply typing "make" at the top level.

2. Using CMake build system. 
   You will need to create a build tree from which to invoke CMake.
   
   First, in order to use parallel symbolic factorization function, you
   need to install ParMETIS parallel ordering package, and define the
   two environment variables: PARMETIS_ROOT and PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR

     setenv PARMETIS_ROOT <Prefix directory of the ParMETIS installation>
     setenv PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR ${PARMETIS_ROOT}/build/Linux-x86_64

   Then, the installation procedure is the following.

   From the top level directory, do:

     	mkdir build ; cd build
   	cmake .. \
	  -DTPL_PARMETIS_LIBRARIES="${PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR}/libparmetis/libparmetis.a;${PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR}/libmetis/libmetis.a" \
          -DTPL_PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS="${PARMETIS_ROOT}/include;${PARMETIS_ROOT}/metis/include"

  ( example:
  setenv PARMETIS_ROOT ~/lib/dynamic/parmetis-4.0.3 
  setenv PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR ${PARMETIS_ROOT}/build/Linux-x86_64 
  cmake .. \
    -DTPL_PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIRS="${PARMETIS_ROOT}/include;${PARMETIS_ROOT}/metis/include" \
    -DTPL_PARMETIS_LIBRARIES="${PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR}/libparmetis/libparmetis.a;${PARMETIS_BUILD_DIR}/libmetis/libmetis.a" \
    -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-std=c99 -g" \
    -Denable_blaslib=OFF \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..
  )

   To actually build, type:
   	make

   To install the libraries, type:
        make install

   To run the installation test, type:
        make test
        (The outputs are in file: build/Testing/Temporary​/LastTest.log)


   ++++++++
   Note on the C-Fortran name mangling handled by C preprocessor definition:
   ++++++++
   In the default setting, we assume that Fortran expects a C routine
   to have an underscore postfixed to the name. Depending on the
   compiler, you may need to define one of the following flags in
   during the cmake build to overwrite default setting:

   cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DNoChange"

   cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DUpCase"
